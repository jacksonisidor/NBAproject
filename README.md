# NBA Data Science Project

# Overview
This repository contains a data science project analyzing NBA data. The project aims to tackle much of the data science process, including performing data preprocessing and cleaning with pandas, creating visualizations in Tableau, and implementing regression and machine learning models using scikit-learn.
All original data files used are from Sumitro Datta on Kaggle as seen in the 'preprocessing.ipynb' file. The csv files in the 'Data' folder are the outputted files from my preprocessing that are used in all of the analysis and models. 

# Project Structure
preprocessing.ipynb: 
- Jupyter Notebook containing the data preprocessing and cleaning steps.

'visualization' Folder:
- ASG_Factors.md containing visualizations of season statistics and their relationship with all-star selections.
- HOF_Factors.md containing visualizations of career statistics and their relationship with Hall of Fame status.

careers.csv:
- Dataset containing NBA players' career statistics.

modern_seasons.csv: 
- Dataset containing NBA season statistics (modern era).

seasons.csv: 
- Dataset containing NBA season statistics (since 1947).
