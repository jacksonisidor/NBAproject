# Preliminary Analysis of Career Statistics and Hall of Fame Inductions

## Introduction
This project involves constructing predictive models to assess both retired players' Hall of Fame eligibility and active players' likelihood of entering the Hall of Fame. To establish an effective model, identifying the key factors influencing a player's induction into the Hall of Fame is crucial. As a preliminary step, I generated visualizations using Tableau to glean insights into the attributes that distinguish NBA Hall of Famers. These insights will guide me into the next step of conducting precise statistical analyses aimed at uncovering correlations necessary for building an accurate predictive model.

## Visualizations

- The scatterplot below displays the relationship betwen number of all-star appearances and Hall of Fame status. The count represents the number of all stars an individual player has and the length of the yellow bar represents the percentage of players with that count that is in the Hall of Fame
