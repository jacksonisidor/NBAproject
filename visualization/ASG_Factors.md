# Preliminary Analysis of Season Statistics and All-Star Selections

## Introduction
Part of this project is building a model that can accurately predict all-star selections for a given season. To create an effective model, I must determine what factors are most important in a player becoming all-star.
As a preliminary check, I produced a few visualizations in Tableau to gain insight towards what makes an NBA All-Star. Using this information, I will perform the proper statistical tests to find exact correlations to build an accurate model.
