# Preliminary Analysis of Season Statistics and All-Star Selections

## Introduction
Part of this project is building a model that can accurately predict all-star selections for a given season. To create an effective model, I must determine what factors are most important in a player becoming all-star.
As a preliminary check, I produced a few visualizations in Tableau to gain insight towards what makes an NBA All-Star. Using this information, I will perform the proper statistical tests to find exact correlations to build an accurate model.

## Visualizations

### Usage Percentage vs Minutes Per Game (Scatterplot)

This scatterplot illustrates the relationship between Usage Percentage (Usg%) and Minutes Per Game (MPG) for NBA players.
  - **Significance:** The visualization helps us understand how often a player is involved in their team's offensive plays (Usg%) compared to how much they are on the court (MPG).
  - **Insights:** Players in the top right corner of the scatterplot have high Usg% and MPG, indicating that they are both frequently involved in plays and spend a significant amount of time on the court. 
  - **Analysis:** The concentration of All-Star players in the top right corner suggests that All-Stars are often heavily relied upon by their teams in terms of both usage and playing time.
  - **Filter Impact:** No filters were applied to this visualization.
